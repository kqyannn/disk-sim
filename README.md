## Deployment

1. (Preferably) Install the latest version of Java SDK and Java JRE. 
2. In your console of choice, change directory to the folder where the `.jar` file or `.exe` file named DiskSim is located. 
3. Run the the program using the commands listed below depending if you use the `.jar` file or the `.exe` file (Windows).

### Jar File Execution
1. For other OS with Java installed, type the following: `java -jar DiskSim.jar`

### EXE File (Windows users only)
1. Simply type the following: `start DiskSim.exe`

###
You can also run the jar and/or exe files by simply opening either of the files.


## Test Case File Format

For the import file format, two parameters are needed: Queue and Head. Queue is the list of space separated numbers from 0 to 199, inclusive. Head is the location of the disk head which can be located from 0 to 199, inclusive. It is never required to have one of the queue numbers as the location of the head. Example of the format is found at `DiskSim-Testcase.txt`.

Sample example :
```
Queue: 10 20 30 40 50
Head: 3
```

## Export File Directory Format

Based on the given template in the input bar, the format is given as
an example: C:/Folder1/Folder2/

If the given directory is invalid, the pdf/png file will automatically saved in the default location, where the executable file is located.

There are two optons: PDF to PNG format. The saved file has a default
filename of this format: mmddyyyy-hhmmss_DS (pdf or png).

Examples:
- 12072020-120730_DS.pdf
- 06072023-120745_DS.png
